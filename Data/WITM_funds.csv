We have had challenges in preparing winning proposals to acquire resources that we need to fulfill our aspirations of adding to the global efforts of advancing women’s rights and support. However, we have been trying to prepare and send out proposals which we strongly pray to be responded to one day.  Our spirit has always been pushing for the feminist agenda from grassroot level even with no or little resources until we reach our desired destination.
